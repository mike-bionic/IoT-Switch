A smart home is a modern building management system that allows you to optimize and manage all the events that take place inside the building.
The Smart Home system manages and connects electronic devices. Coordinates their work. It also helps to make the most of their opportunities. Even when we are away from home, we can remotely control home appliances over the Internet with the help of a computer or cell phone.
It is possible to monitor the condition of the house, the amount of water used in the house or the amount of electricity used.
